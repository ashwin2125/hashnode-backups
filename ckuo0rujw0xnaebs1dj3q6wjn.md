## SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS - Explained !

For any enterprise or an organization, an extensive number of services, products and tools are required in order to run it fully functional.  Earlier, companies were investing heavily to provision the resources, tools, and services on-premises, however it was exceedingly difficult for companies to predict their future demands and scale their requirements precisely.

To overcome this issue,**"as a Service"** model became increasingly popular. In "as---a-service" model, the enterprise/organization can access the required services over the cloud, on-demand rather than investing heavily on-premises unsure of the future demand.

The most widely known "as-a-service" models in cloud are:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service**

2. **Platform as a Service**

3. **Software as a Service**

### Infrastructure as a Service:

- It's a virtual equivalent of a traditional on-premises data center.

- Users don't need to buy hardware and manage its components. In this service, users can deploy their platforms and applications in the cloud, without worrying about buying and managing physical infrastructure.

- The service provider is responsible for the security of the cloud and users are responsible for the security in the cloud.

- Here, the Service providers like Azure, AWS, Oracle Cloud will manage the core infrastructure like Virtualization, Servers, Storage and Networking whereas the users will be responsible for the applications, runtime, middleware, and the OS.
#### Examples: AWS EC2, Azure VM Instances, Google Compute Engine.


### Platform as a Service:


- Platform as a Service is a service that provides complete development and deployment environment in the cloud further simplifying the management of resources by the user.

- Like Infrastructure as a Service, in PaaS, the service provider will manage the middleware, runtime environment, operating system along with Virtualization, Servers, Storage and Networking. 

- Users can concentrate on managing the application and data without worrying about the rest of the resources.
#### Examples: Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure SQL Database.


### 3. Software as a Service:

- SaaS provides a complete end-to-end software solution that users can purchase on pay-as-you-go pricing from a cloud service provider and start straightaway work on the application.

- Users don't need to manage anything on a SaaS, as everything from hardware to app functioning, will be managed completely by the SaaS provider.
#### Examples: Cisco WebEx, Office365, Gmail, DropBox

**To put things in a simple way:**
