# Searching Algorithms and it's Time Complexities

### Bubble Sort :

- Take larger element to the end, by reportedly swapping the adjacent elements.
- **Time Complexity** : 
        Best Case : O(N) - When the array is sorted
        Worst Case: O(N*2) - When the array is reverse sorted.

### Insertion Sort :
- Insert the element in the correct position in a sorted part.
- **Time Complexity** : 
        Best Case : O(N) - When the array is sorted
        Worst Case: O(N*2) - When the array is reverse sorted.    

### Selection Sort :
- Repeatedly find the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
- **Time Complexity** : 
        Best Case : O(N*2)
        Worst Case: O(N*2)
