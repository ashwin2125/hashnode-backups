## Basic Employee Referral Etiquettes

## E-Mail :

 - Add a clear subject line. Here is a reference: "_Your Name_ - Applying for a _Your Role_". Subject line is more important since employees will be receiving a lot of emails. 
 
-  Do not be generic and ask for any job. It makes you look bad. 

 - If you know who you are writing the email to, please address them by their first name. No "Dear Sir/Madam" please.

 -  Reference from where you saw the opening. "LinkedIn Post, etc." 

 - What makes you stand out among the other candidates. (Most important thing) 

 -  What do you know about the company and why are you interested. (Optional) 

 - Include if you are available to join immediately. This could come in your favor.
 
 -  Leave your email or phone number.


##  Resume: 

 - Try avoiding DOC/DOCX format. Please create it in PDF Format. 
 
 - Name the PDF this way :  "Your Name - Resume / Month Year"

 - Please format and make it look presentable. Spending time here will help you go a long way.

Please spend a couple of minutes just proofreading your email/resume. Avoids errors and missing out details. Also, please make sure you don't include any valueless stuffs you did, in the resume.

Example : If you are from IT Department, "Attended aeronatical workshop in 2017" doesn't count as your co-curriculur activity. 

## LinkedIn : 

 - Do not comment "Interested" and wait to hear back. There'll be 100 more comments like 'Interested' and you think someone will read your comment and give you an opportunity? 
 
 - If the instruction was to email or apply using a link, please follow the instruction. Don't spam the comments section. 
 
 - Use search filters wisely. 



There are a lot of folks looking for a job opportunity at this moment. Hopefully, even if this helps one or two folks get an opportunity because of this, I would be super happy. Hope this helps.

*The smallest of actions is better than the greatest of intentions.*

All the best ❤🤟🏻
