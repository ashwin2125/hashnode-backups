## Holy Land of 'Tamil Eelam'

Even before the Independence to Sri Lanka - Modern Day 'Ceylon', The Tamils(an ethnic race aging back to 3000BC and more) have been continuously getting oppressed and erased from their homeland by the Sinhalese (another ethnic group which settled in Sri Lanka after Tamils) majority government.

The Tamils, an indigenous race with rich ethnic and cultural roots having a long history of having settlements across South-East Asia and traditionally traded with oldest civilizations of the world namely Egypt and Rome even before 2000BC. Tamil language is the oldest living language in the world aging back to more than 3000BC. Tamils homeland is in the South-east part of India and also in 'North and East' part of Ceylon.(Modern-day Sri Lanka)

### Ceylon and the Sinhala Racist Government

After independence(1947) from the British Imperialism, the Sinhalese majority in Ceylon(Modern-day Sri Lanka) took over the government and adopted 'One Language - One Nation' ( [Sinhala Only Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_Only_Act) ) policy in 1956, which made Sinhala the country's sole official language, replacing English. This was interpreted as a concerted move to keep Sri Lankan Tamils out of the Ceylon Civil Service and other government employment. The Act was seen as linguistic, ethnic, and economic prejudice against Ceylon's Tamil-speaking minorities (Sri Lankan Tamils, Indian Tamils, and Sri Lankan Moors). Since they were not fluent in Sinhala, many Tamil-speaking civil servants/public servants were forced to leave. This was a foreshadowing of the massive massacres that occurred in 1956 and 1958, killing hundreds of Tamil civilians.

Meanwhile in Higher Education, the Tamils were forced to score 80% to pass their degrees where as the Sinhalese people were passed even if they scored 30% in educational institutions. The racist Sri Lankan government started triggering the Sinhalese people by picturing the fellow tamils of their country as 'Demons/Enemies' of their ethnic race. 

The Sinhalese people who were in jealousy due to the abilities and intelligence of Tamils started considering their fellow citizens as their enemies. It triggered Anti-Tamil riots all over Sri Lanka where Tamil shops are attacked, tamil men were burnt alive and tamil women were raped on the streets.

Defending this move, the tamils started peaceful protest against the ceylon government. The government in return arrested all the peaceful protesters and locked them in jail. The government ordered to open all the cells inside the jail and asked the Sinhalese prisoners to kill the tamils if they wished to be released. The Sinhalese criminals in jail used this opportunity to set themselves free and massacred the peaceful protesters.

### The Need for a Seperate Country

After 10 years of continued struggle and massacres, Tamils came united under under 'Thandhai Selva', a tamil lawyer and a humanitarian and made a resolution to demand a seperate state ruled by tamils, for Tamil people phrased "Tamil Eelam"

Ceylon Government rejected their demand and started arresting tamils who raised their voice against racist government. 

Sinhala government also banned import of books/movies from another tamil homeland 'Tamil Nadu' which was seen as a tactical move to blind tamils from attaining knowledge.
