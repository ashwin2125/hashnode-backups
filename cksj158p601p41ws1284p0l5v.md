## About Me

## Hey there, I'm Ashwin Gounder👋🏼 

A **Software Engineer**💻 with comprehensive knowledge in **Data Structures**❤ and **Full-Stack Development.**👨🏽‍💻

Though I'm working in the industry which I love😍, I'm still curious to explore new things💡. There's certainly a lot more to learn 📚 , develop 🔨 and create 🐣. I owe a great debt of gratitude💯 to my parents 👪 and mentors 👨🏽‍🏫 for pushing me to get to where I am now🏢. 

Outside of work, you'll find me to be a curious learner 🤑, occasional writer 📝, and an ardent lover of UI Designs 🖥 and music 🎶.

Competencies: Java, JavaScript, Databases, Machine Learning and Cloud Engineering. 🤹🏽‍♂️
